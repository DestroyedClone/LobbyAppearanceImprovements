## Pad Scale, Props, Shaking

You can resize the size of the character pads to make the background easier to see. The props can be disabled, and so can the shaking.

## Scenes
Newly added with version 1.1.0, now you can set the background of the lobby to a different look. 

## Character Layouts
Previously known as "Survivors In Lobby", this shows survivors in the background at preset locations and may add new things to the existing scene.

Some layouts are locked behind mods being loaded, and all scenes and layouts are case-sensitive.

## Shadow Locked Characters
Configuration option included that darkens all characters that are locked within a layout. May not work if the character is spawned outside of the regular method. Does not include characters selected by other players.
