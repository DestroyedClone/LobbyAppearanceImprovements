This mod contains multiple settings which change the look, scene, and even character layout of the lobby.
This mod is likely incompatible with other mods that modify the lobby scene itself, as such, mods like ScrollableLobbyUI are compatible.

## To-Do
* Automated things for unsupported characters
* Selected character replaces layout character
* Some layouts have been disabled, fix them
* Add musictrack overrides
* Add more events for scenes

## Default (For Reference)
This was taken with KingEnderBrine's [ScrollableLobbyUI](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ScrollableLobbyUI/) and [RandomCharacterSelection](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/RandomCharacterSelection/).

## Shadow Locked Characters
Configuration option included that darkens all characters that are locked within a layout. May not work if the character is spawned outside of the regular method. Does not include characters selected by other players.

## Scenes
This config selects different backgrounds for the lobby.

## Layouts

This shows survivors in the background at preset locations and may add new things to the existing scene.

Some layouts are locked behind mods being loaded, and all scenes and layouts are lowercase.

## Changing Scenes+Layouts
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/LobbyAppearanceImprovements/master/readme/tutorial.webp)

1. Click on the Wrench icon, with four lines behind it, to open the Mods configuration menu provided by InLobbyConfig.
2. Expand the "Lobby Appearance Improvements" config menu.
3. Expand the "[Scenes+Layouts]" config category.
4. Set the name of your scene in "Select Scene"
5. Set the name of your layout in "Character Layout Name"
6. Check the "Confirm Choice".
	7. If you are updating your choice, you'll need to set Confirm Choice to false before setting it to true.

## List of Scenes w/ Layouts
 If a scene/layout has a 🔒 before it, that means that the scene/layout is locked to only load with those survivors installed.
